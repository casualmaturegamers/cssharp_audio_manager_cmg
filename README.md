# cssharp_audio_manager_cmg
Allows the player to control in game audio levels. If the game is too loud and you can't hear your teammates in your Gun Game server, this is the mod for you.


Install: Just paste the build into the counterstrike sharp addons folder.

How to use: Type !audiomanager or !am to open. follow menu prompts to select option. Copy output and paste into console. CS2 doesn't currently allow for server site cvar changes so the player will have to do this part. The add on will give you the exact command to paste into console based on the settings you picked in the add on.
